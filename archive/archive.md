Archived Design Notes
---------------------

 - Players stop early
   - Give them something to care about, such as filling the screen fully. A percentage, perhaps?
   - Break player expectations early and often?
 - The seminar players focused a lot on the gameplay and tetris aspects.
   - Lean harder into tetris? make pieces come automatically?
   - The tetris aspects confuse people, they think they need to clear lines. Any way to break that confusion?
 - Text
   - One piece of relevant text at a time.
