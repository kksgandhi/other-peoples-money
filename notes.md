TODO:

 - add music

Design possibilities:

 - adding women's health stuff, NIH stuff (nature article about women's health vs men's health). Historically black universities. Buying an Island, stupid Jeff Bezos stuff.
 - Here's what you chose, here's what other people chose
 - zooming out to see your whole stack.
 - text fades out, rather than disappearing immediately

Stretch Goals:

 - Getting the game working on mobile

Research:

Does my target audience exist? Why don't people want to tax the rich? Why don't people approve of large projects.

Research Notes
--------------

Research Question: How does "explicit text" affect the reflective play experience â€” where "explicit text" is text that touches on (or even directly spells out) the reflective goals of the game. Does text serve as an anchor aiding in reflection, or does it irritate or distract players from reflection they would have done otherwise? This question is too broad to answer in one study, but this study will provide evidence in a specific context.

(Other words? Bridging Moments? Didactic messaging? Explicit messaging? Clear-Cut Communication?)

Ideal transformations (reflective goals):

 - Disposition: Players more positively favor reasonably expensive large projects, possibly via taxation.
 - Knowledge: Players better understand what an order of magnitude is, and how large projects that all seem "expensive" can still be separated by orders of magnitude.
 - Behavior: Players will be more likely to logically reason about the expense of a project, rather than quickly assuming it is expensive.

Research Plan:

 - Do 5ish playtests to polish the game, and as a pilot.
 - Do 7ish playtests of each version and talk about the differences.

Playtest questions: (Ask Alexandra if she has any edugame specific playtest questions)

 - Standard Questions
   - Think aloud during the playing of the game
   - Describe this game
   - What could have been explained better or earlier when I was teaching the game?
   - What kind of emotions or feelings did you feel / notice as you played?
 - Reflective Questions
   - Is there anything for which your attitude changed?
   - Is there something new you feel like you learned?
   - Are there actions you took previously, that you'd change after the playing of this game.
 - Comparative Questions
   - Was the text annoying?
   - How would you feel about <modified version of this game>

Two versions, one with minimal text, the other with all the quotes and things

Facts to include:

 - Include the Margaret Thatcher Quote at the beginning
 - What percent of the area is remaining?
 - Convert the money each billionaire has into the amount an American would need to make in a year
 - No, you can't just take the money billionaires have, it's all tied up in stocks. Nor can you just throw money at your problems.
 - during the pandemic, richest made...
 - Maybe some sort of fact about trickle-down economics?
 - Bring up the money per U.S. resident of big spending items.
 - 400 people is enough to fill a ballroom...
 - Investment is an odd profession, it's the only one where the barrier to entry is having money previously
 - If U.S. land was distributed like U.S. wealth?
 - Of 108 countries ranked, there are only 27 with a higher inequality than the U.S.
 - U.S. is 27th of 82 in social mobility

Stretch Research Ideas
----------------------

 - does the backfire effect lead to transgressive play?
 - Can we take some of the sidebar ideas and add visual metaphors for them? Make them gameful?

Technical notes
---------------

Screen is 1440 x 810

in game I use 1000 dollars as the base currency which in retrospect was a stupid decision
in the json the units are billions of dollars (this might have actually been changed though...)

Archived Design Notes
---------------------

 - Players stop early
   - Give them something to care about, such as filling the screen fully. A percentage, perhaps?
   - Break player expectations early and often?
 - The seminar players focused a lot on the gameplay and tetris aspects.
   - Lean harder into tetris? make pieces come automatically?
   - The tetris aspects confuse people, they think they need to clear lines. Any way to break that confusion?
 - Text
   - One piece of relevant text at a time.
