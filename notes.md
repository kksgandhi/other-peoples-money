TODO:

 - Lower the loading time by loading the game during the intro cutscene (Maybe by using placeholders or background loading?)
 - Adding a lot of text (and making a version without all that text)
 - Improving the game's visuals
 - Playtesting

Design possibilities:

 - this area represents the wealth -> "yes, this entire area"
 - add a gradient to the main area so that it's clear what's in the main area.
 - adding women's health stuff, NIH stuff (nature article about women's health vs men's health). Historically black universities. Buying an Island, stupid Jeff Bezos stuff.
 - flip the money summary and the sidebar text. Have the money summary show up on the side, have the text show up as a debrief after the game is finished.
 - Here's what you chose, here's what other people chose
 - zooming out to see your whole stack.
 - text fades out, rather than disappearing immediately

Stretch Goals:

 - Getting the game working on mobile

Research Notes
--------------

Research Question: How does "explicit text" affect the reflective play experience â€” where "explicit text" is text that touches on (or even directly spells out) the reflective goals of the game. Does text serve as an anchor aiding in reflection, or does it irritate or distract players from reflection they would have done otherwise? This question is too broad to answer in one study, but this study will provide evidence in a specific context.

(Other words? Didactic messaging? Explicit messaging? Clear-Cut Communication?)

Ideal transformations (reflective goals):

 - Player has an increased understanding of income inequality and the costs of various initiatives (specifically how projects that all seem expensive can have large differences in actual costs).
 - Player is more willing to support increased program funding via taxation.

Research Plan:

 - Do 5ish playtests to polish the game, and as a pilot.
 - Do 7ish playtests of each version and talk about the differences.

Playtest questions: (Ask Alexandra if she has any edugame specific playtest questions)

 - Standard Questions
   - Think aloud during the playing of the game
   - Describe this game
   - What could have been explained better or earlier when I was teaching the game?
   - What kind of emotions or feelings did you feel / notice as you played?
 - Reflective Questions
   - Is there anything for which your attitude changed?
   - Are there actions you took previously, that you'd change after the playing of this game.
 - Comparative Questions
   - How would you feel about <modified version of this game>

Version 1:

 - Minimal instructions, e.g. this area represents the wealth, here are things you can spend their money on. 

Version 2:

 - Include the Margaret Thatcher Quote at the beginning
 - What percent of the area is remaining?
 - Convert the money each billionaire has into the amount an American would need to make in a year
 - No, you can't just take the money billionaires have, it's all tied up in stocks. Nor can you just throw money at your problems.
 - during the pandemic, richest made...
 - Maybe some sort of fact about trickle-down economics?
 - Bring up the money per U.S. resident of big spending items.
 - 400 people is enough to fill a ballroom...
 - Investment is an odd profession, it's the only one where the barrier to entry is having money previously
 - If U.S. land was distributed like U.S. wealth?
 - Of 108 countries ranked, there are only 27 with a higher inequality than the U.S.
 - U.S. is 27th of 82 in social mobility

Stretch Research Ideas
----------------------

 - does the backfire effect lead to transgressive play?
 - Can we take some of the sidebar ideas and add visual metaphors for them? Make them gameful?

Technical notes
---------------

Screen is 1440 x 810

in game I use 1000 dollars as the base currency which in retrospect was a stupid decision
in the json the units are billions of dollars (this might have actually been changed though...)

Archived Design Notes
---------------------

 - Players stop early
   - Give them something to care about, such as filling the screen fully. A percentage, perhaps?
   - Break player expectations early and often?
 - The seminar players focused a lot on the gameplay and tetris aspects.
   - Lean harder into tetris? make pieces come automatically?
   - The tetris aspects confuse people, they think they need to clear lines. Any way to break that confusion?
 - Text
   - One piece of relevant text at a time.
