TODO:

 - Updating to Godot version 4.3 when it comes out, making sure the Mac / Safari issue isn't happening
 - Lower the loading time by loading the game during the intro cutscene (Maybe by using placeholders or background loading?)
 - Adding a lot of text (and making a version without all that text)
 - Improving the game's visuals
 - Playtesting

Stretch Goals:

 - Getting the game working on mobile

Design Notes
------------

 - Players stop early
   - Give them something to care about, such as filling the screen fully. A percentage, perhaps?
   - Break player expectations early and often?
 - The seminar players focused a lot on the gameplay and tetris aspects.
   - Lean harder into tetris? make pieces come automatically?
   - The tetris aspects confuse people, they think they need to clear lines. Any way to break that confusion?
 - Text
   - One piece of relevant text at a time.

Technical notes
---------------

Screen is 1440 x 810

in game I use 1000 dollars as the base currency which in retrospect was a stupid decision
in the json the units are billions of dollars

Ideas:

 - add sliders for wealth disparity
