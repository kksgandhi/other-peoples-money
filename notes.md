TODO:

 - Updating to Godot version 4.3 when it comes out, making sure the Mac / Safari issue isn't happening
 - Lower the loading time by loading the game during the intro cutscene (Maybe by using placeholders or background loading?)
 - Adding a lot of text (and making a version without all that text)
 - Improving the game's visuals
 - Playtesting

Stretch Goals:

 - Getting the game working on mobile

Design Notes
------------

 - Players stop early
   - Give them something to care about, such as filling the screen fully. A percentage, perhaps?
   - Break player expectations early and often?
 - The seminar players focused a lot on the gameplay and tetris aspects.
   - Lean harder into tetris? make pieces come automatically?
   - The tetris aspects confuse people, they think they need to clear lines. Any way to break that confusion?
 - Text
   - One piece of relevant text at a time.

Research Notes
--------------

Research Question: How does "explicit text" affect the reflective play experience â€” where "explicit text" is text that touches on (or even directly spells out) the reflective goals of the game. Does text serve as an anchor aiding in reflection, or does it irritate or distract players from reflection they would have done otherwise? This question is too broad to answer in one study, but this study will provide evidence in a specific context.

Ideal transformations (reflective goals):

 - Player has an increased awareness of income inequality, the differences between the costs of various projects, and the possibilities of increased program funding via taxation.
 - Player is more willing to support taxation of wealthy Americans.

Technical notes
---------------

Screen is 1440 x 810

in game I use 1000 dollars as the base currency which in retrospect was a stupid decision
in the json the units are billions of dollars

Ideas:

 - add sliders for wealth disparity
