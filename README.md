Millions, Billions, Trillions of dollars are impossible for the human mind to properly contemplate. This game is a meditation on the vast sums of money that are thrown around casually by the richest individuals.

This game is heavily inspired by [this game](https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/), which is much more educational, and [this game](https://direkris.itch.io/you-are-jeff-bezos), which is much funnier.

My goal with this research was to be illustrative, but not necessarily to have a rigorous accounting of costs. Here are some things to think about as your read the sources:

 - The costs are not adjusted for inflation, though I try to make the sources as recent as possible.
 - It does not account for costs at scale (e.g. making 8.1B doses of coronavirus vaccine would require the creation of new factories, extraction of various resources at a never before seen scale.)
 - It does not account for distribution and secondary costs.
 - Some projects are hard to estimate costs for (since they have never been done, like a moon base)
 - Some projects talk only about building cost, but not the maintenance costs.

On the other hand, there are benefits that we aren't accounting for either. Many initiatives put money directly back into the economy (e.g. paying teacher salaries), and even the ones that don't have extremely positive returns on investment (e.g. every dollar invested into clean water provides a $6.08 return).
